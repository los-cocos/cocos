After a release, please update this document if any change was needed.

 1 Checking that the pypi page has proper reST
   To check for reST conformance, somewhere (distutils ? pypi ?) the command
	$ python setup.py --long-description | rst2html.py > output.html
   was suggested. The translation to windows is
        setup.py --long-description | rst2html.py > output.html
   That not worked for me in windows with python 2.6,  I used
	setup.py --long-description  >pypy.txt
	rst2html.py  --traceback  pypy.txt > output.html

 2 Building the docs
   Use the docgen standalone to build docs. see
   http://code.google.com/p/los-cocos/wiki/DocBuild2010
   docgen has instructions about how to build.
   command line example to generate the docs, thats the exact line used to
   build the 0.4.0 docs, windows, python 2.6:
       gendoc_cocos.py --inkscape_cmd="C:\Archivos de programa\Inkscape\inkscape.exe"  --clean --all >my_log.log

   Just in case, use a clean working copy for this, that is ,no extra *.py,
   *.pyc or *.pyo files under cocos\

   Check the log to detect bad epydoc - reST syntax.
   Work the docstrings to reduce errors and warnings.
   A reference log with acceptable errors can be obtained building the docs
   for r987.

   Also, look some random pages in the generated html to see if there are any
   surprises.

 3 Building the package
   command line used in windows:
       setup.py sdist >build.log

 4 Installing the new package for test
   Preparation:
       backup easy-install.pth -> easy-install._pth
       hide any cocos and pyglet visible from python, this depends on how you
       handle multiple version for packages ( .pth ? , PYTHONPATH ?, ...)
       check that import pyglet and import cocos fails with
         ImportError: No module named [pyglet, cocos]

    Install:
        setup.py install >install.log

    Cleanup (after tests are done):
        Delete additions in site-package, restore easy-install.pth, check that
        import pyglet and import cocos fails as before, restore your normal
        machinery to handle multiple package versions for cocos and pyglet

 5 Updating cocos2d.org site
   the ftp URL points to a general directory with things not to touch;
   we are interested in a subset of www directory (which also holds other
   things ).
   Listing only the cocos related files:
   www
    doc -> 	directory with the html docs generated for cocos, update on release
			after building the docs, upload the contents of doc/html to this directory (www/doc)

    coco.png
    contribute.html -> not release related
    doc.html -> links into the doc dir, also links to video tutorials not release related
    download.html -> download links, dependencies, *needs update on release*
    favicon.ico -> 0 sized atm
    games.htm -> sample games, not release related
    grossini.png -> warn, maybe also used for iphone 
    index.html -> the homepage, news and demo videos, *needs update on release*
    style.css
    tetrico.jpg

   In the google code repo there is a section to store this files.
   The doc directory is not stored because is generated by the doc builder.
   To check out:
   svn checkout https://los-cocos.googlecode.com/svn/web/ cocos_site --username google_code_usr

   After editing, upload and test, commit the changes
   
   I just used FTP Commander (free) to upload from 0.4rc0 to 0.5.0, seems to work ok.
 
 6 Updating PyPI page
   Albeit pypi home page tells to use "python setup.py upload" to upload the
   package, this gave me 401: You must be identified to edit package information

   A search suggested

	python setup.py register sdist upload

   which should build, request user:pwd interactively and upload
   In windows xp sp3 with python 2.6 that failed: it request the user,
   you fill it, it request pwd, it wont accept characters.
   You must ctrl-c or wait a timeout.

   Another search suggested using the same line but creating a .pypirc file
   in your HOME directory with the contents
    [pypirc]
    servers = pypi
    [server-login]
    username:pypi_user
    password:pypi_pwd

   Just in case, I stored that with unix line endings.
   That worked for me.
   
   For windows users, you can see where your HOME directory is by typing
     set homepath
   in a cmd console (usually Documents and Settings\<user>)

   Probably more info at:
       http://packages.python.org/an_example_pypi_project/setuptools.html#intermezzo-pypirc-file-and-gpg

7.  tagging the release
	( remember to change the version in the example if doing copy & paste )

svn copy https://los-cocos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ https://los-cocos.googlecode.com/svn/tags/release-0.5.0 -m "tagging release 0.5.0"
