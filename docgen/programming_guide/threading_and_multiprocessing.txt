A few tips on threading and multiprocessing
===========================================

  * be familiarized with cocos and pyglet in single threaded code before attempting threads or subprocess
  * consider to use events and timers instead of threads or subproces
  * multiprocessing: import cocos and pyglet only in one process, see `issue #281 <https://github.com/los-cocos/cocos/issues/281>`_
  * threading

    - the gui thread must be the main thread
    - cocos code is not reentrant or thread-safe; call it only from the gui thread
    - use a queue to communicate with the gui thread; in the gui thread schedule a function to poll (non-blocking) the queue and dispatch as events
  * The pyglet and cocos google groups have a few threads relevant, search there for 'threading' or 'subprocess'
