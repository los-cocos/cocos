Api changes and other compatibility notes

cocos 0.6.7
-----------

First cocos version to support pyglet 1.4, needs at least pyglet 1.4.3

This cocos version will not run with previous pyglet versions

Signature changes that break compatibilty

	- Class cocos.fps.InfoLabel.__init__

For compatibilty with pyglet 1.4 some cocos's classes internal state has changed, which only matters if your code subclass those classes, and / or instantiate and modify instance state from outside. Classes affected:
	- cocos.fps.InfoLabel: member .text changed to .label ; it now holds a pyglet.text.Label
	- cocos.scenes.pause.PauseLayer : member .text changed to .label ; it now holds a pyglet.text.Label

Old user code that access underlying pyglet objects may need to adjust to breaking changes in pyglet 1.4; the ones we encountered were:

pyglet.font.Text no longer exists; pyglet sugestion is to replace with pyglet.text.Label. Not a drop-in replacement because the API is diferent, pay attention to differences in parameters types.

pyglet.clock.ClockDisplay no longer exists, use pyglet.clock.FPSDisplay

pyglet constants for text layout like pyglet.font.LEFT no longer exist, use the string lowercase of last member, "left"

what about textures??
	
cocos 0.6.5
-----------

	- First cocos version to support pyglet 1.3 , tested against pyglet 1.3.rc1
	- Does not support pyglet 1.4 series
	- This cocos version can also run with pyglet 1.2.x
	- Next cocos version will drop support for python 2.6
	- Python 2.7 support can end at any future cocos release, without further advice: if pyglet drops it or a cocos new feature requires more than trivial compatibility code, then cocos will be py3 only

cocos 0.6.4
-----------

Imports in cocos library are more specific, so user code that were doing
``from cocos.somemodule import *`` may fail to find some symbols.
To fix that user code, add explicit exports as needed.

MapColliders classes changed API to be more useful and clear. 
    - :class:`~.mapcolliders.RectMapCollider` moved to his own module, 
      :mod:`.mapcolliders`.
    - :class:`~.mapcolliders.RectMapCollider` was renamed to 
      :class:`.RectMapWithPropsCollider`.
    - The new :class:`~.mapcolliders.RectMapCollider` handles a simpler 
      collision case, when all tiles are solid: now no need to set cells 
      properties to signal a cell border should not be walked over.
    - :class:`.TmxObjectMapCollider` now handles AABB collision with any 
      :class:`.TmxObject` that can be loaded.

:meth:`.Rect.intersects()` now it only intersects if some interior points
overlaps.

Removed :class:`.Scene` methods ``push_all_handlers()`` and 
``remove_all_handlers()``.

In :class:`.ScrollingManager` two methods have been renamed, the old name is
still valid but will be removed in the future:

  - ``pixel_from_screen()`` \-> ``screen_to_world()``
  - ``pixel_to_screen()`` \-> ``world_to_screen()``
