"""Pygame module for loading and playing sounds.

This module contains classes for loading Sound objects and controlling
playback. The mixer module is optional and depends on SDL_mixer. Your
program should test that pygame.mixer is available and initialized before
using it.

The mixer module has a limited number of channels for playback of sounds.
Usually programs tell pygame to start playing audio and it selects an
available channel automatically. The default is 8 simultaneous channels,
but complex programs can get more precise control over the number of
channels and their use.

All sound playback is mixed in background threads. When you begin
to play a Sound object, it will return immediately while the sound
continues to play. A single Sound object can also be actively played
back multiple times.

The mixer also has a special streaming channel. This is for music
playback and is accessed through the pygame.mixer.music module.

The mixer module must be initialized like other pygame modules, but it has
some extra conditions. The pygame.mixer.init() function takes several
optional arguments to control the playback rate and sample size. Pygame
will default to reasonable values, but pygame cannot perform Sound
resampling, so the mixer should be initialized to match the values of
your audio resources.


NOTE: there is currently a bug on some windows machines which makes
sound play back 'scratchy'.  There is not enough cpu in the sound
thread to feed the buffer to the sound api.
To get around this you can increase the buffer size.  However this
means that there is more of a delay between the time you ask to play
the sound and when it gets played.  Try calling this before the pygame.init or
pygame.mixer.init calls.  pygame.mixer.pre_init(44100,-16,2, 1024 * 3)

    Initialize the mixer module for Sound loading and playback. The default
    arguments can be overridden to provide specific audio mixing. The size
    argument represents how many bits are used for each audio sample. If the
    value is negative then signed sample values will be used. Positive values
    mean unsigned audio samples will be used. If the stereo argument is false
    the mixer will use mono sound.

    The buffer argument controls the number of internal samples used in the
    sound mixer. The default value should work for most cases. It can be
    lowered to reduce latency, but sound dropout may occur. It can be raised
    to larger values to ensure playback never skips, but it will impose latency
    on sound playback. The buffer size must be a power of two.

    Some platforms require the pygame.mixer module to be initialized after the
    display modules have initialized. The top level pygame.init() takes care
    of this automatically, but cannot pass any arguments to the mixer init. To
    solve this, mixer has a function pygame.mixer.pre_init() to set the proper
    defaults before the toplevel init is used.

    It is safe to call this more than once, but after the mixer is initialized
    you cannot change the playback arguments without first calling
    pygame.mixer.quit().
