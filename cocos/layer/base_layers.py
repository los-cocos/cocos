"""Layer class and subclasses.

Layers are typically thought as event handlers and / or as containers that help
to organize the scene visuals or logic.

The transform_anchor is set by default to the window's center, which most of the
time provides the desired behavior on rotation and scale.

By default a layer will not listen to events, his `is_event_handler` must be set
to True before the layer enters the stage to enable the automatic registering as
event handler.
