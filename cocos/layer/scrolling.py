"""This module defines the :class:`ScrollableLayer` and 
:class:`ScrollingManager` classes.

This module helps to handle what will be visible on screen when the game world
does not fit in the window area.

It models this concept: the game world is a big volume. We have a camera
that follows the actor moving parallel to one of the volume faces, without 
rotations. What the camera sees is what  will be seen on the app window. Also, 
the camera's movements can be restricted in order not to show parts outside 
of the world. This technique is usually named *'scrolling'*.

It has support for parallax rendering, that is, faking perspective by using
layers that slide slower the farther they are.

The important concepts are:
  - The coordinator, implemented as :class:`ScrollingManager` which enforces the
    view limits imposed by the managed layers, accounts for layer's parallax.

  - The managed layers, implemented each by a :class:`ScrollableLayer`, which as
    a group holds all the entities in the world and each one can define what
    area of the x-y plane should be shown on camera.

  -The focus, tied to ScrollingManager ``fx`` and ``fy`` attributes, which 
    indicates that point (fx, fy) in world coordinates is the point of interest,
    and should show at the center of the *screen view* if no restriction is
    violated.

    If ``px_width`` is defined, then ``px_height`` must also be defined; scrolling
    will be limited to only show areas with origin_x <= x < = px_width and
    origin_y <= y <= px_height).

    If ``px_width`` is not defined, then the layer will not limit the scrolling.

    A layer may have a ``parallax`` value which is used to scale the position
    (and not the dimensions) of the view for the layer - the layer's view
