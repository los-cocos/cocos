"""
Custom clocks used by cocos to perform special tasks, like:
    - recording a cocos app as a sequence of snapshots with an exact, fixed framerate
    - jump in a predefined sequence of timestamps taking snapshots

dev notes:
There's code duplication here, but having separated codepaths would help to
follow changes in pyglet 1.2dev. When released, we could refactor this with
some confidence.

References to the classes defined here are discouraged in code outside this
module because of possible changes.

The public interface should be
    - get_recorder_clock
    - set_app_clock
