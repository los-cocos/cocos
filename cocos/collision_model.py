# collision manager interface
class CollisionManager(object):
    """
    Answers questions about proximity or collision with known objects.

    After instantiation or after calling its 'clear' method the instance
    don't knows any object.

    An object is made known to the CollisionManager instance by calling its
    'add' method with the object instance.

    Example questions are:

        - which known objects collides with <this object> ?
        - which known objects are near than 6.0 from <this object> ?

    Note that explicit objects in the question (call) don't need to be known to
    the collision manager answering the question.
    If the explicit object indeed is known, then it is omitted in the answer as a
    trivial case.

    There can be multiple CollisionManager instances in the same scope, and
    an object can be known to many collision managers at the same time.

    Objects that can be known or can be presented to a Collision Manager in
    a question must comply with:

        - obj has a member called cshape
        - obj.cshape supports the interface Cshape

    Such an object can be called 'a collidable' in the documentation, and when
    'obj' or 'other' is seen in the code you can assume it means collidable.

    While usually all collidables in a collision manager are of the same class
    (CircleShape or AARectShape) it is allowed to use both types into the same
    collision manager.

    The known objects collective for each CollisionManager instance is
    manipulated by calling the methods

        - clean() \: forgets all objects and empties internal data structures
        - add(obj) \: remember obj as a known object
        - remove_tricky(obj) \: forgets obj

    When objects are made known to a collision manager, internal data structures
    are updated based on the obj.cshape value at the 'add' moment.
    In particular, the obj.cshape indirectly tells where in the internal
    structures certain info will be stored.
    Later, the internal data structures are used to accelerate answers.

    This  means that modifying obj.cshape after an 'add' can produce a memory
    leak in the next 'remove_tricky', and that in the same situation some
    answers can be partially wrong.
    What type of wrong ? It can sometimes miss a collision with a know
    object that changed it cshape.

    It is user code responsibility to drive the know objects update when
    obj.cshape values changes.

    Common use patterns that are safe and efficient:

    When most of the known objects update cshape each frame

    You do::

        # updating collision info
        collision_manager.clear() # fast, no leaks even if changed cshapes
        for actor in moving_actors:
            collision_manager.add(actor)

        # game logic
        # do what you need, but defer changes in cshape to next block
        # by example
        for actor in moving_actors:
            actor.new_pos = actor.cshape.center + dt * vel
            #other logic that potentially needs collision info;
            #it will be accurate because you have not changed cshapes
            ...

        # update cshapes for next frame
        for actor in moving actors:
            actor.cshape.center = actor.new_pos

    Example actors for this case are player, enemies, soldiers.

    All of the known objects don't change Cshapes

        - At level start you add all objects
        - When an actor reaches end of life use 'remove_tricky' to make it not known, no problem because his cshape has not changed

    Examples actors for this case are food, coins, trees, rocks.

    Implements the CollisionManager interface based on the scheme
    known as spatial hashing.

    The idea behind is to divide the space in rectangles with a given width and
    height, and have a table telling which objects overlaps each rectangle.

    Later, when the question 'which know objects has such and such spatial
    relation with <some object>' arrives, only the objects in rectangles
    overlapping <some object> (or nearby ones) needs to be examined for the
    condition.

    Look at CollisionManager for other class and methods documentation.
