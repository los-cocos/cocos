"""Support for handling collisions between an actor and a container of objects"""

class RectMapCollider(object):
    """Helper to handle collisions between an actor and objects in a RectMapLayer

    Arguments:
        velocity_on_bump (str) : one of ``"bounce"``, ``"stick"``, ``"slide"``.
            selects which of the predefined on_bump handlers will be used
    Attributes:
        on_bump_handler : method to change velocity when a collision was detected
        bumped_x (bool) : True if collide_map detected collision in the x-axis
        bumped_y (bool) : True if collide_map detected collision in the y-axis

    The code that updates actor position and velocity would call
    method :meth:`collide_map` to account for collisions

    There are basically two ways to include this functionality into an
    actor class

        - as a component, essentially passing (mapcollider, maplayer) in
          the actor's __init__
        - mixin style, by using RectMapCollider or a subclass as a secondary
          base class for actor.

    Component way is more decoupled, Mixin style is more powerful because
    the collision code will have access to the entire actor trough his 'self'.

    To have a working instance the behavior of velocity in a collision must be
    defined, and that's the job of method `on_bump_handler`

        - if one of the stock on_bump_<variant> suits the requirements, suffices
            `mapcollider.on_bump_handler = mapcollider.on_bump_<desired variant>`
          or passing a selector at instantiation time
            `mapcollider = MapCollider(<desired variant>)`

        - for custom behavior define on_bump_handler in a subclass and instantiate it.

            The dt involved in 'last' -> 'new' is small enough that no object
            can entirely fit between 'last' and 'new'.

        Side effects:
            ``new`` eventually modified to not be into forbidden area.
            For each collision with one object's side detected, the method
            ``self.collide_<side>(obj)`` is called.

        if rect ``new`` does not overlap any object in maplayer, the method
            - does not modify ``new``.
            - returns unchanged (vx, vy).
            - no method ``self.collide_<side>`` is called.
            - ``self.bumped_x`` and ``self.bumped_y`` both will be ``False``.

        if rect ``new`` does overlaps any object in maplayer, the method:
            - modifies ``new`` to be the nearest rect to the original ``new``
              rect that it is still outside any maplayer object.
            - returns a modified (vx, vy) as specified by self.on_bump_handler.
            - after return self.bumped_x  (resp self.bumped_y) will be True if
              an horizontal (resp vertical) collision happened.
            - if the movement from ``last`` to the original ``new`` was stopped
              by side <side> of object <obj>, then self.collide_<side>(obj) will be called.

        Implementation details

        Adjusts ``new`` in two passes against each object in maplayer.

        In pass one, ``new`` is collision tested against each object in maplayer:
            - if collides only in one axis, ``new`` is adjusted as close as possible but not overlapping object
            - if not overlapping, nothing is done
            - if collision detected on both axis, let second pass handle it

        In pass two, ``new`` is collision tested against the objects with double collisions in pass one:
            - if a collision is detected, adjust ``new`` as close as possible but not overlapping object,
              ie. use the smallest displacement on either X or Y axis. If they are both equal, move on
              both axis.
